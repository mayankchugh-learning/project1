First time git setup:

For the first time git configuration, you use the following commands:

git config --global user.name "random”

Using this, you will enter your GitHub username
git config --global user.email “mayank.chugh@gmail.com”
Using this, you will enter your GitHub username

You only need to run the following git commands to commit any changes into your git repository and push those changes to GitHub:

git status: Used to check which files are changed and not yet moved to the staging area
git add filename or git add : Used to add specific files giving the filename or using the ‘git add .’ command to add all the unstaged files to the staging area
git commit -m “New commit message”: Gives a new commit message and commits all the files sitting in the staging area
git push -u origin master or git push: Used to upload all the files and changes that were included in the most recent commit to your remote repository on GitHub

git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "Second commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/mayankchugh1977/project1.git
git push -u origin master

git push -u origin branch3

git branch branch1
git branch branch3

git checkout branch1

git checkout master

git meage branch1

git meage branch3

git branch -d branch1


git diff master..branch1

git diff

--projectPrelearning

git add projectPrelearning

git commit -m "first commit"

git remote add origin https://github.com/mayankchugh1977/project1.git
git push -u origin master

git status

git add projectPrelearning/src/algo/module/one/Demo.java

git commit -m "added documentation projectPrelearning/src/algo/module/one/Demo.java"

git remote add origin https://github.com/mayankchugh1977/project1.git
git push -u origin master
git clone url


git checkout -- filename: This command helps you when you have made some modifications to your file, say, file1, and you haven’t added those changes to the staging area or development history. Using this command will take you back to its previous state.

git revert commit_id: This command helps you when you have already staged your files and committed the changes and want to go back to your previous commit. Instead of removing the previous commit from the project history, git revert will figure out how to undo the changes introduced by the previous commit and appends a new commit that reverts the content and the changes introduced by the previous commit. This prevents git from deleting any commits, which is important to maintain the integrity of your revision history
git reset --hard commit_id: This command helps you when you have already staged your files and committed your changes, want to go back to your previous commit, and want to remove your present commit.Specifically, this command tells git to think of <commit_id> as the latest commit in your history and revert any file to what they were at <commit_id>. Any commit that you made after <commit_id> will no longer be in your history. In other words, git will dispose of any commits that happened after <commit_id> as if they never took place.


In this video, you learnt about —

Merging branches: For merging, you can use the command git merge <branchname>

Note: This command will merge the changes in the branch <branchname> with the branch that you are currently working on. Merging can happen between all the branches. Imagine that you have three branches, namely —

Master

Branch1

Branch2

                    You can merge any one of the branches above with another one.

Deleting branches: You can use the command git branch -d <branchname>

 

Let's learn more about the git diff command.

The git diff command: This command is used to show the changes performed between commits. The main objective of version control is to enable you to work with different versions of the same file. Hence, git provides the command 'diff' to allow you to compare between the different versions of your files. The most common scenario where 'diff' is used would be when you need to see what changes you had made after your last commit. Ways in which we can use the 'git diff' command:

git diff commitid1 commitid2: To see the difference between two commits using their commit IDs

git diff branch_name1..branch_name2: To see the difference between two different branches. Here, 'branch_name1' represents the branch you are currently working on

git diff: This will show you all the changes made to all the files and branches, all at once
----------------------------------------------------
There are several problems when commits are directly pushed to master

If you push a work-in-progress state to remote, the master is potentially broken
If another developer starts work for a new feature from master, she starts with a potentially broken state. This slows down development
Different features/bugfixes are not isolated, so that the complexity of all ongoing development tasks is combined in one branch. This increases the amount of communication necessary between all developers
You cannot do pull requests which are very good mechanism for code reviews
You cannot squash commits/change git history in general, as other developers might already have pulled the master branch in the meantime

git branch <branchname>: This command will create a branch with the given branch name

git branch: This command will show you all the branches along with the HEAD pointing to the branch you are currently working on

git checkout <branchname>: If you want to move from one branch to another, you can run this command


Local repository is only available on the computer that it resides, i.e. its files, changes, commits, etc. cannot be seen by people using other computers. On the other hand, a remote repository is stored on Github (or any other Git hosting service), and its files, changes, commits, etc. in a repository can be accessed by other people with an internet connection. In other words, you would make changes to the project files, and commit those changes in your local repository. After which, you would push the commits in your local directory to a remote directory when you want to share those commits with other people.


git clone url

On using the command 'git log --oneline', you should see —

One commit per line

The first seven characters of the commit SHA

The commits message

Basically, you may use the command 'git log --oneline' to see the commit details in one line along with all other mandatory details of the commit.
